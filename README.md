# 📊 Case Study  
## Workforce Intelligence Dashboard – Demographics & Turnover

![Headcount Dashboard](1ff.jpg)

---

## Executive Challenge

HR leadership lacked a consolidated, executive-ready view of workforce performance.  

Critical workforce indicators — including headcount growth, hiring velocity, termination trends, and demographic distribution — were fragmented across systems and manual reports.

As a result:

- Workforce planning was reactive  
- Turnover risks were not visible early  
- Executive reporting required significant manual effort  
- Strategic people decisions lacked real-time insight  

---

## Strategic Objective

Design a centralized Workforce Intelligence Dashboard to:

- Establish a single source of truth for HR metrics  
- Provide real-time headcount and turnover visibility  
- Enable leadership to monitor hiring performance  
- Surface demographic and job-level insights  
- Support data-driven workforce strategy
